#### The blame tool

Ever see a piece of completely incomprehensible code? Want to know who to complain to? **Git blame** is here to help!

When you click on a file on GitHub, there's a button that says 'Blame' on the top right:

If you click it, it'll give you something that shows who made the change, and with what commit that changed happen. It can be very useful for debugging things!

Unfortunate side effect - I find that half the time when I use the blame tool to see who wrote a terrible piece of code, that it was me :(
